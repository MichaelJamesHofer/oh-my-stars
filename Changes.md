<!-- User Input -->

Bring the POI count to 10. Make the route go somewhat vertically (vertically diagonal like a gentle zig-zag), so that a user can scroll the page like a normal website.
Add more random stars everywhere as part of the foreground (i want them to move when the view moves). They need to move at different speeds to provide a feeling of depth. Do it as a function of size - the smaller the star, the father it is and the less it moves in the view. The smallest stars in the background layer move, but even less than the predetermined function.
Make the background almost completely dark. have varying dark orange, blue, green, and purple as random noise clusters in the background with edges fading into the black.
Make the dashed ring effect around the POIs thicken by 2x on hover.
Make the POI colors less saturated, make them match the size of the foreground stars around them, and make them glow more than the randomly generated ones (all the other stars should glow as a function based on their size).
