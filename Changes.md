## User Input

- Reduce the average size of stars in the background by 50% (keep the same size range, just bias the generation).
- Reduce the scrolling-related speed and motion by 50% on the starfield (but nothing else).
- Add a header and footer in the top and bottom margins of the screen above and below the starfield, and just add placeholders for those, background color solid black. The header is not sticky (it doesn't stay on the screen when you scroll down).
- Add an "X" in the upper right corner of the POI boxes that closes the box.
- Make the POI boxes feel more digital (maybe a monotype font? and a YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS somewhere on it).
- Change the POI box closing animation to shrink to the center both horizontally and vertically, and make it no longer than 0.2 seconds.



## Agent Output

- Reduce parallax effect by 50% for stars only
- Add fixed black bars at top and bottom of screen
- Style POI boxes with monospace font and timestamp
- Add a close button to POI boxes
