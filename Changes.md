<!-- User Input -->

Make it 2D, keep the route close to the center of the screen.
Make the boxes animation grow from the POI location towards the right (make the box grow up and down as a single vertical line from the vertical center to form the left edge, then expand to the right, and fade in the contents), instead of flying in from the upper left to center on the POI location.
Make the boxes content static, no generated information - It needs to be changeable by a backend user later.
Make the other stars round instead of square, and make their colors random (they need to be light colors, e.g. a sky blue instead of solid blue - saturation should be around pastel lightness).
make the route lines a gradient from one POI to another
make the POIs static, but procedurally generate the others. Also style them so that the range of star sizes is much more varied, and instead of making POIs significantly bigger, set some varied size too. Instead make a 7-dash ring around each one indicating it's a POI.
Make all stars glow (emission texture or whatever three.js calls it)
Make the camera view scroll up or down automatically to center on the selected POI prior to the box animation.
Add a slight gradient to the background, using blue, violet, green, and orange, one in each corner and black in center. (can be static.)
Add a slight gradient to the background inside the box (but keep it dark- just adding a tiny bit of depth)

<!-- Agent Output -->

2D View: Switched to an Orthographic camera.
Background: Added a corner-to-center gradient background shader.
Stars: Made round with a texture, pastel-colored, varied sizes, and additive blending for glow.
POIs: Defined statically, styled with varied sizes and a dashed, glowing ring indicator.
Route: Implemented as gradient line segments between POIs.
Info Box: Uses standard DOM elements, static content, subtle background gradient, and animates by growing horizontally from the left-center edge of the POI after the camera centers.
Camera: Smoothly animates to center on the selected POI before the info box appears.
Controls: Adjusted for 2D panning and zooming.
