<!-- User Input -->

Change the POI colors to be slightly less saturated and more bright. Make a heavier glow gradient (like a bloom effect), rather than a sharp cutoff. Make them slightly smaller (60%).
Change the foreground stars so their maximum random size is the same size as the POIs and make them circular.
Change all foregound and background stars to have the same muted colors, a glow/bloom effect that increases with their percieved size, and a subtle twinkle effect that decreases with percieved size.
Change the relative speed at which stars move, make this effect about 10x of what it is currently.
Change the background color so that there are no visible seam lines - solid black on all 4 edges.
Change the Box animation to start from vertical center and expand up and down on the left edge before the current animation that expands it to the right.
Change the Box style to have a thin line around it in the color of the POI
Change the connecting lines to be white
Add the ability to use a scroll wheel to scroll, just like a webpage.
