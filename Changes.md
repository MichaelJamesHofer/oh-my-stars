<!-- User Input -->

Change the foreground stars to be 2x the size, and multiply the particle qty by 3x.
Change the number of POIs from 10 to 7 and re-distribute the colors accordingly. Reposition them, so the distance and direction of each line is unique (so it feels less like a repetitive pattern).
Change the POI glow effect to be smooth on the outer edges. 
Change the glow effect on foreground *and* background stars to 1.7x stronger.
Once opened, the box doesn't open a second time. revert to the previous behavior for now.
Invert the scrolling direction, it's backwards right now.
