Things I want to add:

Dark mode on site
  Make the entire view crack into peices, and then fall down revealing a light theme, maybe with a static grey image texture in the background (solid white for now). To return to dark mode, simply fade back into the stars.

Camera-move-to-POI feature: Use cameraTargetY (currently unused) to smoothly animate the camera to a selected POI when this feature is implemented.
