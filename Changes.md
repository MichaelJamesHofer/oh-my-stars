<!-- User Input -->

Change the foreground stars to be smaller, and make sure the original shape is visible- not just a soft color. Also remove the opaque black hitboxes as they are visible when one star overlaps another. 
Change the POI stars to be smaller too, and make their glow effect about half the size and smoother (i can still see the edges). Make each POI a different color, from one end of the color spectrum to the other.
Change the box so that when it is open, prevent it from re-opening.
Change the scroll speed when using a scroll wheel to be 10x faster, but keep the same deceleration speed.
Change the entire map to be 50% smaller. The distance from the top of the POIs to the bottom is too much for a user to navigate.
Change the loading so that the view starts at the top of the POIs, not the center.
